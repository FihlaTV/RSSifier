About RSSifier
------

A PHP class to generate a valid RSS XML feed of any website using the PHP 5 built in DOM parser.

This is an alternative to the [PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser](http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/) which is slow and extremely memory consuming.

To-Dos
------
- [ ] parseDOMtable is not really generic for different websites
- [ ] parseDOMelement is not flexible enough for different websites
- [ ] If $prefillValue 'DOMtype' is given, the correct dropdown entry in the Form should be pre-selected
